# Data Networks Assignment 3 - MAC Layer Simulation

This folder contains my submission for Homework 3 for the Data Networks course. The goal of this assignment is to gain experience simulating and implementing MAC layer protocols.

## Overview

The assignment covers the following MAC protocols:

- Ethernet CSMA/CD  
- HDLC
- Wireless MAC protocols
- ALOHA
- Slotted ALOHA
- CSMA 
- CSMA/CA with backoff (like 802.11 WiFi)

Both theoretical analysis and simulation exercises are included.

## Contents

The repository contains:

- `Codes/` - Simulation models and code for OMNeT++, WSim, etc
- `report.pdf` - Report explaining algorithms, results, and analysis

Protocols simulated:

- TDMA
- Stabilized ALOHA
- CSMA
- CSMA/CA with contention window

## Running Simulations

The code in the `simulations/` folder can be imported into the appropriate simulator (OMNeT++, WSim, etc). Instructions are provided in comments in the code.

The report provides an overview of the simulation models, parameters, results, and analysis.
