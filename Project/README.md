This folder contains my submission for the final project for the Data Networks course. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Linux networking concepts.

## Overview 

The project covers the following topics:

- Virtualization and hypervisors

For each topic, explanations, Linux commands, and screenshots are included to show the required tasks being completed.

## Recommended Reading

The book "CUMULUS NETWORKS Linux 101" by Cumulus Networks provides useful background and examples for Linux networking concepts covered in this project.

## Contents

This document contains:  

- `Report_latex_source/` - LaTeX source code for generating the report
