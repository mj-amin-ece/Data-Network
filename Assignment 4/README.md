# Data Networks Assignment 4 - Network Layer Simulation

This folder contains my submission for the network layer homework assignment. The goals of this assignment are to gain experience with simulating OSPF networks and visualizing network layer activity.

## Overview 

The assignment covers:

- Simulation of an OSPF network in OMNeT++
- Visualizing network layer activity
  - Enabling visualization
  - Filtering visualized traffic
  - Visualizing mobile ad-hoc networks

Both simulation models and analysis are included.

## Contents

The repository contains:

- `part1/` - OSPF network simulation
  - `OSPFTopology.ned` - Network topology definition
  - `ASConfig.xml` - OSPF router implementation
  - `omnetpp.ini` - Simulation configuration

- `part2/` - Network layer visualization
  - `VisualizerToplogy.ned` - Network definition for visualizer
  - `omnetpp.ini` - Configuration

- `report.pdf` - Report explaining models, analysis, and results

## Running the Simulations

The simulation models can be imported into OMNeT++. The report provides details on the configuration and analysis for each part.
